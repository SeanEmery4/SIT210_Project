# SIT210_Project
This folder contains source code for my project for SIT210 - Embedded Systems Development project.
This prototype is for an obstace detection system on a remote controlled car.
The on board system contains a Sharp IR sensor and Particle Argon
The central system is a raspberry pi with a GUI, 4 relay bank and buzzer
Communication between the two is through MQTT.
